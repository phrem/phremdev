# 👋 Hi, I'm Watcharapun Tatomwong

Backend & system-focused developer with real production experience.  
I specialize in maintaining, fixing, and improving existing systems rather than building flashy demos.

---

## 🧠 What I do best
- Backend development with **Node.js / NestJS**
- Database work with **Prisma** and large datasets
- Fixing performance bottlenecks
- Debugging production issues
- Long-term system maintenance
- API integrations (REST / SOAP / gRPC)

I usually work with systems that are already live and need stability, clarity, and ongoing care.

---

## 💼 How I work
- Prefer **async communication** (GitHub Issues / email)
- Clear written explanations and step-by-step investigation
- Practical solutions based on real constraints
- No unnecessary meetings

---

## ⏰ Availability
- Working hours: **20:30 – 21:00 (GMT+7)**
- Response time: within **24 hours**
- Emergency support only for production issues

---

## 🤝 Engagement type
I'm open to:
- Bug fixing
- System investigation
- Performance tuning
- Monthly maintenance (5–10 hours/month)

If you're a small team or solo founder without a dedicated backend engineer, I can help keep your system running smoothly.
